Majority of the problems have been solved in Java, some were done using Python. </br>
Feel free to take a look if you're stuck.</br>
No use of copying my solutions, as you won't learn anything.</br>
Plus there are way better ways to solve many of the questions, because I started solving problems on Beecrowd sometime during the very early days of my programming journey. And at that time, I wasn't aware of many competitive programming concepts. </br>
If I had the time, I'd redo and change my code for some of the questions. </br>
So, the more optimized solutions... I'll leave that to you to figure out. ;)</br>

<i>Happy coding! </i>
